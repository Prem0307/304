Title:- Ronot controller

Goal of the Project:
In class 283, we started a Ramp follower Controller. We learned how controllers can simulate the Robot. We learned about the basic robot controller programming using Python language.


Story:
Rohan knows about webots. Even he designed one Robot. But now he is curious to know about how robots control everything. So he decided to work on a robot controller that moves upward or downward the ramp. He wants to program the controller to simulate the Robot movements.

Specific Tasks to complete the Project:
Create a new controller file.
Go to wizards
Click on the new Robot controller, name the file and select the language as Python.
Save the controller file.
Add the libraries
Reference Code:

from controller import Robot
from controller import Motor
from controller import Altimeter
from controller import LED
import math
Define a class MyController and define the functions __init__ and run in it.
Create an object of MyController and start the execution
Reference Code:

# main Python program
controller = MyController()
controller.run()
Define the variable for Motors, accelerometer and LEDs.
Set the acceleration for rotational Motors.
